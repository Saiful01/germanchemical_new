                    <h4>1. Communication Skills</h4>

                    The ability to communicate clearly and effectively in many mediums: by email, verbally, with lists
                    and phone
                    messages, on the phone, and with body language. Communication also includes listening skills and the
                    ability to
                    follow directions and provide feedback.

                    <h4>2. Honesty</h4>

                    Employers want accurate and timely information regarding their business and their employees. Made a
                    mistake?
                    Don’t cover it up, admit it, and learn not to do it again.

                    <h4>3. Technical Competency</h4>

                    Most positions require certain skills that are advertised on the Job Posting. If you are hired to
                    perform
                    certain tasks then you should have the skills. Improving your skills along the way is also expected.

                    <h4>4. Work Ethic</h4>

                    Be at work on time, do what you were hired to do, meet targets and deadlines and work to the best of
                    your
                    ability. What more could an employer ask?

                    <h4>5. Flexibility</h4>

                    Employers and their employees need to react quickly to changing business conditions. Employers need
                    employees
                    who can change gears and adapt as required.

                    <h4>6. Determination and Persistence</h4>

                    Managers will give employees challenging goals but generally they are achievable. The key is to be
                    able to work
                    hard and keep moving forward when you encounter obstacles.

                    <h4>7. Ability to Work in Harmony with Co-Workers</h4>

                    Employers and managers like to have people working with them and for them who can get along with
                    their
                    colleagues and who can work with others effectively in different circumstances.

                    <h4>8. Eager and Willing to Add to Their Knowledge Base and Skills</h4>

                    As businesses change, there is often a need to find out new information, expand knowledge and
                    explore new ways
                    of doing things. People with an interest in learning, and a willingness to pass it on to others,
                    become
                    invaluable.

                    <h4>9. Problem-Solving Skills</h4>

                    Companies are looking for people who are motivated to take on challenges with minimal direction.
                    Employees
                    should see when something needs to be done and react accordingly.

                    <h4>10. Loyalty</h4>

                    Employers want and need to be able to trust their employees to work professionally to meet the
                    employer’s best
                    interests. Employers do not want to hire people who require close scrutiny or who cannot be trusted
                    to represent
                    the company in public.
